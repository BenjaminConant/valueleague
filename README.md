Created at the 2015 FinTech Hackathon.

Value League is a platform that delivers daily investment competitions based on real time stock market data. Our goal is simple: to make learning about investing in financial markets fun, simple, and accessible to anyone.

Every day our users join a game and pick one stock from the S&P 500. To pick a stock users put one dollar of their own money into the pool. Users track their stocks progress over the course of the day, and at market close the user who's stock has the greatest percentage increase in price wins the pool.

Check out the app (still in beta) deployed to OpenShift at: http://valueleague-valueleague.rhcloud.com/ .
